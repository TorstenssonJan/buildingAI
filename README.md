# Project Titel
Building AI course project

Make sure NLP chatsbots are not so afraid of new-thought theories and other non verified information.

## Summary

I want the chat enginges to be more openminded regarding information. There might be an upcoming issue regarding variation in information. Psycologically humans avoid to continue searching efter they have found one answer that is enough. But that is not enough for a growing mind. Searchenginges have been a great tool to spread new type of information and free-thinking around the world.

## Background

I want to make sure the variety of information is maintained on the Internet as we move in to an era of information filtering.


## How is it used?

TBD

## Data sources and AI methods
TBD

## Challenges

The limitation is how to actually guarantee that the information variety is included in the new text-chats. There are already issues regarding bias in the image generation tools out there. And there might be the same issue regarding test-chats. The risk of misuse the information flow, controlling the answers and the information peoples can get is an area need some handling.
This project doesn'e state any solutions or any more details right now. 2024-03-04. But to be continued.

## What next?
